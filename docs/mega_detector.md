# Mega-Detector

The Mega-detector is a trained YOLO object-detection model, capable of identifying 
object of 3 classes (animals, vehicles, and humans). 

Please refer to the core documentation provided at: [https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md)
for more information. Many thanks to the amazing work they have already accomplished in the Wildlife sector. 

The Mega-detector process comprises 3 separate repositories. Below are the links to each one, for further information:
